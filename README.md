# Low-Level Programming Language and Data Structures

This repository contains an implementation of a low-level programming language and various data structures. The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet powerful language and efficient data structures that can be used for system-level programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

## Programming Language

The low-level programming language included in this repository is designed to closely map to the underlying hardware architecture. It provides direct access to memory, registers, and low-level operations, allowing for fine-grained control over the system resources. The language is minimalistic and efficient, focusing on performance and low-level operations rather than high-level abstractions.

### Features

- Direct memory manipulation: The language allows direct access to memory locations, enabling efficient implementation of low-level algorithms and data structures.
- Bitwise operations: Bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, shift, and rotate are supported, providing efficient manipulation of individual bits or groups of bits.
- Pointers and memory management: Pointers are used to reference memory locations, and the language provides basic memory management operations, including allocation and deallocation.
- Inline assembly: The language allows inline assembly code, enabling direct interaction with the underlying hardware and access to specific instructions or features not provided by the language itself.

### Getting Started

To get started with the low-level programming language, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git`
2. Navigate to the language directory: `cd low-level-language`
3. Compile the language compiler: `make`
4. Write your program in the low-level language, using the provided syntax and features.
5. Compile your program using the language compiler: `./compiler <input_file> -o <output_file>`
6. Execute the compiled program: `./<output_file>`

Refer to the language documentation for detailed information on the syntax, supported features, and examples.

## Data Structures

In addition to the low-level programming language, this repository also includes efficient implementations of various data structures. These data structures are designed to minimize memory usage and provide fast access, insertion, deletion, and searching operations.

The following data structures are currently implemented:

1. Array: A fixed-size array with constant-time access and modification operations.
2. Linked List: A dynamically-sized linked list with constant-time insertion and deletion operations at the beginning and end.
3. Stack: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure with constant-time push and pop operations.
4. Queue: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure with constant-time enqueue and dequeue operations.
5. Binary Tree: A binary tree structure with efficient traversal, insertion, and deletion operations.
6. Hash Table: A hash table implementation for fast key-value lookups.

Each data structure is implemented in a separate module, providing a clear and modular way to use and understand them. Additionally, comprehensive documentation and usage examples are provided for each data structure.

### Usage

To use the data structures in your program, follow these steps:

1. Include the desired data structure module in your program.
2. Instantiate the data structure object.
3. Use the provided methods and operations to interact with the data structure.

Refer to the data structure documentation for detailed information on usage, methods, and examples.
